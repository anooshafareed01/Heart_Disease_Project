# Heart_Disease_Project
Heart Disease Prediction Project This project analyzes patient data to predict heart disease using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and models like logistic regression and decision trees. Insights identify key risk factors, enabling early detection and improved healthcare outcomes.

Day 1: Focuses on initial data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the identification of key risk factors. The groundwork for predictive modeling is laid with feature engineering and data cleaning.

Day 2: Builds on the foundation by implementing and evaluating machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods. Hyperparameter tuning and performance metrics are used to refine the models for better accuracy and reliability.

The project aims to uncover data-driven insights for early detection and intervention, leveraging the power of predictive analytics.
